# Jokester App
For my final project at Flatiron School, I created a Jokester application. You will be able to view different jokes, add a new joke, and delete a joke. You can learn more about the reasoning behind the creation of the app by clicking the "about" page. 


## Installation
1. IMPORTANT! Download the backend repository and follow backend steps first:

Link to backend repository: https://github.com/riannacastro/joke-backend

2. Download this repository
3. Open terminal 
4. run `npm start` in terminal. It will ask you if you want to run on a different port, please enter `y` in the terminal. It will open up localhost:3001 
5. You are set up to use the application! Have fun!

## Usage

The "Home" page is a welcome page to greet the user. The "About" page explains why this application was created and how to use it. The "Jokes" page has all of the jokes that you can take a look at and read! Feel free to play around and delete a joke of your choice. If you want to add a new joke, you can go to the "New Joke" page, and enter a new joke there. When clicking submit, you will be able to see your added joke on the "jokes" page.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
